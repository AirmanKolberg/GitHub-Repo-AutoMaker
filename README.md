# GitHub Repository Helper!
Just a simple script to use when setting up a new GitHub repository, utilising of course GitHub's API.  This script is short enough to be edited to match anyone's needs or preferred languages, but I've set this up for my quick automation tools and bots in Python, as this is most often what I'm doing when I'm starting on new projects.  Enjoy!
